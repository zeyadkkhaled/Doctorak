# Doctorak

**Doctorak** is a full-stack healthcare appointment booking platform inspired by Vezeeta. It allows patients to easily find and book appointments with doctors while enabling doctors to manage their schedules, patients, and medical records. The platform includes role-based authentication and an admin dashboard for full control over the system.
